    "title": "To resurrect a project: 14C Power and Sensitivity (week 1)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Hello everyone and welcome to what is likely first post on my blog. Today, I’ll provide a b it of a background on a project I am about to resurrect and which some of you might find interesting. Since far too long ago I was working on and off on developing a better idea of how to do quantitative research design in radiocarbon dating, in other words, how to stick a probability distribution on an estimate of how precise the results we’ll be before we take any measurements (power analysis) and evaluate whether the end models are as trustworthy as the HPD areas imply (sensitivity analysis).\nThe Readme in the Github project repository should contain all the details in serious academic format. However, for those not familiar with radiocarbon chronological modelling here are the bare bone basics:\n\nRadiocarbon dating is based on estimating how much of the radioactive 14C isotope has decayed from an organic sample. This involves measuring atoms that show at very small rates, with all the associated contamination risks and precision difficulties.\nRadiocarbon levels fluctuated in the past, so measurement need calibrated to get a meaningful date. How do we do this? We use a calibration curve based on 14C measurements of stuff for which we know the age through some other means (dendrochronology is best, but for the older periods other isotopic dating methods, or varve counting are often used).\nIn most serious radiocarbon work we no longer use single dates - rather we take series of measurements and estimate dates of events of interest (e.g. when was this site abandoned) by using Bayesian chronological modelling.\nUnless you’re French speaking, you’re likely doing your Bayesian chronological modelling using OxCal.\nOxCal is great at what it does, but it does not provide functionality to easily simulate a lot of models with slight changes to simulation input parameters. Which is a convoluted way of saying: if you want to do enough simulations to do quantitative research design in OxCal alone, you will spend a lot of time on manual drudgery.\n\nThe project that I’m off to resurrect was about cutting out the manual part - instead of passing new simulations into OxCal and taking notes on how individual results looked, I wrote scripts to generate simulations from tables of inputs, scripts to pass the input models to OxCal via the command line, and scripts to parse the results out of the OxCal output .js files (no, it’s not a typo - OxCal results come in .js). I got as far as having simulated 300k+ different models and setting up a Shiny App to visualize the outcomes when the pandemic fight call-up came along and I no longer had time to work on this. Until now. Over the next few weeks I hope to revisit the project and at least complete the analytics on the simulations produced to date (I have ambitions to package the functions to simulate and read the .js files… but I haven’t opened to code yet).\nSee you next week with (hopefully) some initial results on the sensitivity side!"

    "text": "Welcome back everyone! This took a little longer to put together than anticipated. Truth is, I kinda got carried away with the analytics, turned around and thought “oops, time to write up things that happened a couple weeks ago”. So here they are.\nThe plan for this post was to have a look at the old project archive and start figuring out what can be done. As discussed in the previous post, the project itself is all about running thousands of simulated radiocarbon dates and modelling them to make actual sampling more data-driven. The simulations all got done before I went off to fight the pandemic two years ago, alongside some tools for data exploration. So I took some time over the past couple of weeks digging through those old project folders, choosing a particular set of simulations to focus on and taking things forward from there. This week we’ll focus on the actual stuff that was left behind from the academic days, as well as beginning to explore the simulated data for single radiocarbon calibrations."

    "text": "Things left behind\nSo the project itself covered three types of radiocarbon models: single calibrated dates, radiocarbon wiggle-match dates, and relatively simple “sequence” models.\n\nThe first type of model is just Bayesian calibration of a 14C determination to a calendar date (see this post on calibration if you’re curious what that is).\nThe second type of model is a Bayesian wiggle-match date - a bunch of radiocarbon measurements where we know how much time elapsed between the samples - most often gets used for tree-rings (you can find the model ran in a spreadsheet here).\nThe third type of model were “Sequences” - groups of dates where we have some idea of contemporaneity and ordering of the dates, but no information on their exact chronological relationship. So, for example, we know that bone A got deposited before bone B, but no idea how many years apart. Unlike single calibrations and wiggle-match dates, these kinds of models come with multiplicity of parameters and in general use MCMC. If you want to know more, check out the intro on the Historic England website.\n\nFor each of three kinds of models, I’ve run several different kinds of simulations. Some focused on particular time periods, others on how results changed with different calibration curves, while other still were concerned with obtaining large mass of simulated measurements over different time periods. Looking through the project archive I found that last category most interesting, and thought I’d start with it. I though I’d begin with single calibrations to brush up on some key tools, practice new ones, and de-cobweb the brain."

    "text": "Single calibrations: how did they get simulated and how many I’ve got?\nOver the next few installments we’ll be focusing on whether the calibrated date estimates we simulate are accurate given different offsets and other model parameters. Before we move forward you might ask how did the simulated radiocarbon dates get simulated in the first place? The procedure is quite simple - you can find it outlined in code in this file here. In essence, it’s all about looking at a value on the calibration curve, moving it by a bit to simulate a systematic offset, and then drawing a normally distributed random number to simulate an actual measurement. The curve itself is a marvel of statistics (check it out), but the bit we work with is a simple table of calendar years, alongside their expected values on the radiocarbon scale and estimate uncertainty. Once I’ve had the curve, I chose a systematic offset at random - after all, a large part of the project is to check how sensitive we are to such offsets. I set those offsets to between -50 and 50 14C year, which is at the limit of difficult to spot lab screw-ups combined with weird atmospheric effects. After then it’s just about following the recipe:\n\nGet a vector of measurement errors (this is the known uncertainty around our simulated measurements) .\nChoose a point at random one the calibration curve.\nCheck the expected 14C age at our chosen spot.\nShift the chosen value by the offset.\nDraw a random number from a normal distribution with a standard deviation corresponding to the measurement error.\nPaste the random numbers together and calibrate using the program OxCal (I just passed the files via the command line from R).\n\nOnce we get the calibrated results we check whether the 68.2% and 95.4% HPD areas estimated by OxCal contain the known target dates and calculate a few other things to which we might return in a few weeks.\nLooking through the project archive, this leg included 10,000 simulations from across the tree-ring based part of the calibration curve - looking at the period from zero to 12,300 Before Present (cal BP). The first step was to re-acquaint myself with the data. Thankfully there was a Shiny App that I built two years ago for just that purpose…"

A note on notation before going forward:\n\nTarget years are in Calibrated Years BP (Cal BP) - normal calendar time, counted backwards from 1950. Yes, the future is now.\nOffset magnitude and measurement uncertainties are counted in radiocarbon years (14C yrs). These are not actual time units, but rather transformed estimates of radiocarbon concentration. Think of them as standardized units for this type of analysis.

On a conceptual level this makes sense - the less precise the measurement, the greater the chance that the output model will hit the target date by accident. Having said that, I would expect that for measurements with very small systematic offsets, high-precision measurements should do just fine.\n\n\nCode\n### Heatmap here\nsingles_data %>%\n  mutate(\n    target_year = plyr::round_any(target_year, 800),\n    measurement_error = plyr::round_any(measurement_error, 8)\n  ) %>%\n  group_by(target_year, measurement_error, ) %>%\n  summarize(\n    `68.2% HPD Area` = mean(accuracy_68),\n    `95.4% HPD Area` = mean(accuracy_95)\n  ) %>%\n  pivot_longer(c(`68.2% HPD Area`, `95.4% HPD Area`), names_to = \"hpd_area\", \n               values_to = \"ratio_accurate\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = target_year, y = measurement_error)) +\n  geom_raster(aes(fill = ratio_accurate)) +\n  facet_wrap(~hpd_area) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Target year\",\n    y = \"Measurement error\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    panel.border = element_blank(),\n    strip.background = element_rect(\n     color=\"white\", fill=\"white\"\n     ),\n     text = element_text(family = \"Corbel\")\n    )\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'target_year'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring the old Shiny App also highlighted one other interesting interaction. It seems like more precise measurements suffer more in light of systematic offsets in more recent millennia (we can see it by tiles getting darker in the lower-right hand corner of the figures below). This, alongside the other observation about more recent dates being less robust to systematic offsets, suggests that where we are in time may have an impact on the accuracy of single calibrations."

At this stage we know that measurement uncertainty also might need to be taken into account and that something about the calibration curve might have an impact. We also know that the curve is anything but monotonous, with plenty of features attesting to past states of the sun and the Earth’s geomagnetic field and that the precision of the calibration curve becomes less and less the further back we go in time. Hence, our key challenge moving forward will be to figure out just how much those additional variables matter for estimating the range of systematic offsets that radiocarbon determinations can take before the calibrated dates become less accurate than what the HPD area would imply.\nSee you next week! Or two weeks from now, or however this will pan out."

Last time we left this project, we were on the verge of doing some exploratory modelling to start getting a more precise assessment of patterns we spotted during preliminary visualizations. To recap, we are trying to evaluate how much systematic offsets affect the precision of calibrated radiocarbon date ranges through simulating 10k of those models, with known offsets and checking how they vary. So far we spotted that model accuracy changes through time, as well as based on model precision (more accurate ones tend to get the answers wrong more often). We left off with two ways of approaching the exploratory modelling.\nThis installment focuses on the outcomes of the second approach. TLDR: if we want to push this any further, we need a lot more simulations than the 10k we’ve got."

    "text": "The models explored\nBefore going for our main goal, which is estimating how much offset is dangerous for these kinds of measurements during different time periods, we need to have a good model for describing how difference modelled date ranges relate to different combinations of underpinning factors.\nIn the current approach, I wanted to build seperate models for different points in time, which left me with two variables to consider: - Magnitude of systematic offset (ranging from -50 to 50 radiocarbon years - which are in reality a unit not of time, but of radiocarbon concentration) - Measurement precision (Between 8 and 32 radiocarbon years - less means more precise).\nWith these two variables four models were possible: 1. Offset only, ignoring any information from measurement precision 2. Precision only, ignoring offset magnitude 3. Both offset and precision 4. Offset, precision, and their interaction.\nWhile I was confident a priori that the second model was wrong (and I think you’ll agree with me here), it was unclear how models 3 and 4 would compare, or for that matter whether model 1 might not be better on the grounds of parsimony (yes, measurement precision did seem to matter, but maybe not enough to justify it in model inclusion).\nI did spend some time two or three years ago chasing my own tail on that one time and time again. This time I decided to go for a simpler solution: I just applied all four models across the board, retaining the “dubious” model 2, as a baseline of bad model choice."

This was very, very reassuring - at least one expectation got fulfilled. What was a bit more challenging was that there was no clear winner model.\n\n\nCode\nsingle_cals_log_diagnostics %>%\n  mutate(\n    offset_pos = if_else(offset_pos, \"Pos offset\", \"Neg offset\")\n  ) %>%\n  filter(str_detect(model, \"95\")) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = target_year, y = AIC)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = model)) +\n  facet_wrap(~offset_pos) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"darkblue\", \"blue\", \"steelblue\", \"gray\")) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    panel.border = element_blank(),\n    strip.background = element_rect(\n     color=\"white\", fill=\"white\"\n     ),\n     text = element_text(family = \"Corbel\")\n    ) +\n  labs(\n    subtitle = \"95.4% HPD Area models: AIC values\",\n    x = \"Target Date (Cal BP)\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the 95.4% HPD ranges we have a similar story, but with a few twists. First of all, the AICs are lower than for the 68.2% HPD ranges. This makes sense: in the 68.2% case, we expect a lot more determinations to be off-target because of stochastic nature of measurement. This inbtroduces way more noise, and thus the models have a harder time estimating. In the 95.4% case, the effects of other variables should be more decisive.\nBut taking one look at the graphs, it is clear that the real interesting bit is elsewhere. Model quality is time-dependent - the further back you go, the better the models are at explaining variation in the data. As the big difference in calibration curve structure is that of curve precision, we can expect that to have some impact on model explanatory power - perhaps by providing just a little less precise calibrations, thus further reducing stochastic effects of measurement uncertainty."

In other words, to gain temporal resolution and evaluate the intercept, we would need way more simulations.\nBefore we get there, lets first check our other approach: using the curve uncertainty as means of defining time-dependent factors.

So the other approach was to look at what the actual model results told us. Now, one things that was clear right off the bat was that the “sigma_only” models wouldn’t cut it: they did not perform well for the 68.2% HPD ranges, and also failed to take offset magnitude into the account (the thing we want to be predicting). Second, the offset only models also wouldn’t do, because we know from preliminary visualizations that measurement precision does have an impact on model accuracy and the point is to quantify how much of an impact and under what conditions (not to mention, in practice, measurement precision might be the only thing that the lab teams might have some control over).\nThis leaves to models to choose from.

The first is that the uncertainty around the estimates for the 95% HPD areas is much greater than the uncertainties for the models for the 68% HPD areas. This is as expected: the 95.4% HPD areas have a much higher ratio of things being “on target” and hence the logistic regression has far fewer “failures” to work with - and thus it is harder to get good precision.\nThe second item of interest is that the model without the interaction term produces more precise estimates and that the interaction term is small and very close to zero. Without any other information, this could lead us to choose the non-interaction model as providing better predictions.\nHowever, there is a third item to consider: the sign on the error parameters under the two models. In the non-interaction models the sign tends to be positive, implying that measurements with greater measurement error estimates (i.e. the less precise ones) give us more accurate results. Point. However, this is not true - if we have a situation where there is no systematic offset from the mean of the calibration curve, then a measurement with a precision better than that of the calibration curve will provide the accurate result almost all of the time. Precision only becomes detrimental with offsets and hence the interaction term becomes important for producing a realistic model of the physical situation we are dealing with.\nHaving said that both models still miss one point from the EDA: they do not show any meaningful change through time. When I first saw that, I though, hey, it might just be the case that the difference lies in the baseline accuracy - that is, in the intercept parameter. Alas, I was disappointed:\n\n\nCode\nsingle_cals_log_results %>%\n  filter(str_detect(model, \"interact\") & str_detect(term, \"Intercept\")) %>%\n  filter(!(target_year %in% c(7019, 7751, 9076, 11091) & \n             str_detect(model, \"95\"))) %>%  ## This removes extreme values of the 95% model in the visualizations\n  mutate(\n    offset_pos = if_else(offset_pos, \"Pos offset\", \"Neg offset\"),\n    model = if_else(str_detect(model, \"68\"), \"68.2% HPD\", \"95.4% HPD\")\n  ) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = target_year, y = estimate)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +\n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = estimate - std.error * 2, \n                  ymax = estimate + std.error * 2,\n                  fill = offset_pos), alpha = 0.2, color = \"grey75\") +\n  geom_line(aes(color = offset_pos), linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(offset_pos), rows = vars(model), scales = \"free\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    strip.background = element_rect(\n     color=\"black\", fill=\"white\"\n     ),\n     text = element_text(family = \"Corbel\")\n    ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"steelblue\", \"darkblue\")) +\n  labs(\n    subtitle = \"Intercept estimates from the models containing an interaction term\",\n    x = \"Target Date (Cal BP)\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the estimates did bounce up and down a bit, had any pattern been there, it was lost in the uncertainties. I lacked the power to detect the increase in accuracy through time at this resolution. So I went off and changed the bins."
