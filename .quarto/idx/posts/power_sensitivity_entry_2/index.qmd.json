This took a little longer to put together than anticipated. Truth is, as usual with data projects, there was always the nagging little voice arguing that we should follow the data a little longer... so what's up on the project?\n\nThe plan for week 2 was to have a look at the old project archive and start figuring out what can be done. As discussed in the previous post, the project itself is all about running thousands of simulated radiocarbon dates and modelling them to then be able to suggest data-driven decisions for actual sampling. Now, the simulations all got done (or so I thought!) before I went off to fight the pandemic two years ago, alongside some tools for data exploration. So I some time over the past couple of weeks digging through those old project folders, choosing a particular set of simulations to focus on and taking things forward from there. I'll write up the first batch of analytics next week, this week we'll focus on the actual stuff that was left behind from the academic days.\n\nSo the project itself covered three types of radiocarbon models: single calibrated dates, radiocarbon wiggle-match dates, and relatively simple \"sequence\" models. \n\n* The first type of model is just Bayesian calibration of a ^14^C determination to a calendar date (see this [post on calibration](https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/calibration.html) curious what that is). \n* The second type of model is a Bayesian wiggle-match date - a bunch of radiocarbon measurements where we know how much time elapsed between the samples - most often gets used for tree-rings (you can find the model ran in a spreadsheet [here](https://chrono.qub.ac.uk/blaauw/) if you want the details).\n* The third type of model were \"Sequences\" - groups of dates where we have some idea of contemporaneity and ordering of the dates, but no information on their exact chronological relationship. So, for example, we know that bone A got deposited before bone B, but no idea how many years apart. Unlike single calibrations and wiggle-match dates, these kinds of models come with multiplicity of parameters and in general use MCMC.
